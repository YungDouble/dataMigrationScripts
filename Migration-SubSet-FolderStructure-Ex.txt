SAG SPED Migration – Part Folder Structure
------------------------------------------

Each "Part" folder should follow this structure for consistency and auditing:

Example Layout:

AAA_DONE_IMPORTED_2284
AAA_FILES
FileList_2433.csv
FileCopyLog.txt
SubParts_PendingImport_149
Thumbs.db

------------------------------------------
Folder and File Naming Rules:

1. AAA_DONE_IMPORTED_<count>
   - Contains files that have been successfully imported.
   - <count> must always equal the current number of files in this folder.
   - Update the folder name whenever files are added.

2. AAA_FILES
   - Contains the original source files for this part.
   - This folder should not be renamed or altered.
   - Serves as the reference set for the entire part.

3. FileList_<originalCount>.csv
   - CSV listing all files in the original source set (AAA_FILES).
   - <originalCount> reflects the original file count for this part.
   - This number does not change, even as files move into other folders.

4. FileCopyLog.txt
   - Text log documenting actions, notes, and issues.
   - Example entries:
       [2025-08-27] Imported 150 files from SubParts_PendingImport_300
       [2025-08-27] Renamed 2 files with invalid characters
   - Update continuously during the migration process.

5. SubParts_PendingImport_<count>
   - Holds files staged for the next import batch.
   - <count> must always equal the current number of files in this folder.
   - Update the folder name whenever files are added or removed.

6. Thumbs.db
   - Windows system file, ignore if present.

------------------------------------------
Process Workflow:

Step 1: Place the source files into AAA_FILES.
Step 2: Generate FileList_<originalCount>.csv to capture the original total.
Step 3: Stage files for import in SubParts_PendingImport_<count>.
Step 4: After import, move files into AAA_DONE_IMPORTED_<count>.
Step 5: Update FileCopyLog.txt with details of each action.
Step 6: Always adjust folder names so the <count> matches the actual file count.

------------------------------------------
Key Points:
- Folder name counts (_<count>) are dynamic and must be kept accurate for auditing.
- FileList_<originalCount>.csv is static — it always shows the original file total.
- Keeping this structure consistent ensures anyone can open a Part folder and
  immediately see the status of that set.
